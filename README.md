This is the First Task of my Internship at E-Katta Innovators LLP. This project demonstrates a simple web application for controlling the horizontal movement of a box using left and right buttons. The box smoothly traverses from left to right and vice versa when the corresponding buttons are pressed.

Features:
1. Left and right buttons are provided to control the box's movement.
2. Smooth transition effect during box movement.
3. Easily customizable box size and color via CSS.
4. A clean and minimalistic user interface.
